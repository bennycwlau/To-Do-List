# To-Do-List

A To Do List app is something I use everyday so I thought it would be cool to make my own app for it. 
This is a basic To Do List iOS app, written in Swift, which uses a TableView to show all current tasks in one tab and an option to add new tasks in the next tab. The information is stored on the device using a plist. I'm hoping to add additional features in the future, such as having a separate tab for more priority/time-sensitive tasks or maybe finding a way to integrate the iOS's native alarm clock so you can use alarms to remind yourself that a task needs to be completed.
